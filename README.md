- **Squares of a Sorted Array** - The approach was to use a for loop to loop through the given array then assign the squares of the numbers to the same position. The resulting array is then sorted in ascending order. This ensures we can evaluate arrays of different numbers.
- **Add Two Numbers** - The approach here was to create a placeholder head ListNode and to build the linkedlist from there. We then looped through the values of the provided linkedlists and calculated the digits for the new linkedlist using a carryOver variable that accounts for any number that needs to be carried over. A new node containing the calculated digit is then added to the linkedlist. The loop continues till the provided linkedlists have been traversed and there is no carry over. The next value of the placeholder head is then assigned to a result listnode to get the result linkedlist.
- **Merging Two sorted Lists** - The approach we used was to create a dummy node and set the current pointer to point at the dummy node. The current is what we will use to build the merged list. We then used the while loop to iterate through both of the loops provided they met the condition that both lists are not null. We compare the value of the list1 node to that of list2 node, if it's smaller or equal to it, we link the current node to the list1 node then we move list1 to its next node. Otherwise, If list1 node is not smaller nor equal to list2 node, we then link the current node to list2 node and then move list2 to the next node. If we arrive at the base case, where one list is empty/null, we append the remainder of the other list to the merged list.
- **Missing number** in an array containing distinct integers ranging from 0 to n. The Solution class implements the missingNumber method, which first initializes a HashSet with integers from 0 to n. It then removes each number present in the input array from the set. The remaining number in the set is the missing integer. The Main class demonstrates this functionality by creating an instance of Solution and testing the missingNumber method with various arrays, printing the missing number for each case.
- **The average salary of employees**, excluding the minimum and maximum salaries. In the Solution class, the average method initializes variables to track the minimum and maximum salaries, as well as the total sum of all salaries. It iterates through the salary array, updating these variables accordingly. After processing all salaries, the method computes the average by subtracting the minimum and maximum salaries from the total sum and dividing the result by the number of remaining salaries (m - 2, where m is the length of the array). The Main class demonstrates this functionality by creating an instance of Solution and testing the average method with different salary arrays, printing the resulting average for each case.
